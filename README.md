# DataCleaningAssignment Code information
This code reads the Samsung Data set, merge training and test data, with features selected
among "mean()" and "std()" features.
Then it merges features with activity labels and subject ids.
Finally it produces a new tidy data set, more compact with average features ordered  by subjects ids and activity. The new codeBook of this new dataset can be found in the file CodeBook.md
